# Go Language

Go is quickly becoming one of the top programming languages. While it’s somewhat similar to Python, Python is still more versatile for many tasks. 

However, Go stands out with several advantages that make it a popular choice for developers.

### Why Choose Go?

- **Lightweight:** Go is simple and efficient.
- **Blazing Fast:** It’s much faster compared to many other languages.
- **High Performance:** Ideal for building high-speed and scalable applications.

I’ve been exploring Go with **ChatGPT**, and it’s been a game-changer for improving my coding skills and development logic. If you haven’t tried it yet, you should! This is just the beginning.

### Task 01: **Hello World Program**
Write a Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

---
### Task 02: **Arthimetic Opreators**
Write a Go program that takes two integers as input from the user and outputs their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

---
### Task 03: **FizzBuzz**
Write a Go program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

### Task 04: **Count Vowels and Consonants**
Write a Go program that takes a string input from the user and counts the number of vowels and consonants in that string. For this task, consider the English vowels to be A, E, I, O, and U (both uppercase and lowercase).

Your program should ignore any non-alphabetic characters. Here’s how you might approach this:

1. Read input from the user.
2. Initialize counters for vowels and consonants.
3. Loop through each character in the string to determine if it is a vowel, consonant, or neither.
4. Print the results.

### Task 05: **Simple Calculator**
Write a Go program that functions as a simple calculator. Your program should:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Prompt the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

Perform the chosen operation on the numbers and print the result.
Here’s a quick guide to get you started:

- Use a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user decides to exit.
- Handle division by zero in the case of division operation.
- Use functions for different operations to keep your code organized.
